# Use NPM registry

In March 2020,
[GitHub acquired NPM](https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/) and
will keep it operational as a registry for public JavaScript packages, so as of
now packages can be moved back to NPM.

This supersedes
[ADR 002: Use GitHub package registry](https://github.com/coderbyheart/bdd-feature-runner-aws/blob/320da04ff3a9db05af4e793f2a34d018749024f0/adr/002-use-github-package-registry.md).
