- `@Only`: Run only this feature
- `@Last`: Run this feature after all others

## Note on TypeScript 3.7 Beta

This project makes use of TypeScript 3.7 features, therefore typescript-eslint
is currently disabled
[until it supports them](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/1033).

Also once
[this fix has been published](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33744)
replace `(example?.tableBody ?? []).filter` with `example?.tableBody?.filter`.
